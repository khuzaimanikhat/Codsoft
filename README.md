# Codsoft Internship Projects
TASK 1: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

TASK 2: TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

TASK 5: FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
